Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How the code for retrieving the movie data from the Internet works in detail
2. The different types of data you can load from the Internet and how to load it

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

   The biggest challenge was definitely writing the code to retrieve and load data from the Internet. Since I 
had never done anything that required getting data from the Internet, writing and trying to understand the code
was very difficult and time-consuming for me. Even after getting my app to work, I still don't fully understand
how it works (but I shall continue to try).

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like to go more in depth into customizing the cells.
2. See if you could connect the app to fandango and display movie times/locations.
